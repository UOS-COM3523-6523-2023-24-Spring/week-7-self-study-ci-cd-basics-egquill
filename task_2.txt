Model-based testing that can capture the uncertainty or variability of the system behaviour.

Alternatively, test using data that reflects the non-deterministic behaviour of the system, such as historical data,
online data, or synthetic data. Can help observe how the system behaves in realistic situations.

Maintaining other good practices: keep tests isolated from each other so that execution of one test does not affect
any others, never use bare sleeps to wait for asynchronous responses and instead use callback or polling, and place
non-deterministic tests in a 'quarantine' area.
